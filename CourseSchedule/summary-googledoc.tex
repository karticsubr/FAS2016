The role of sampling.
Practice: 
How samples are used in a typical renderer. 
Show black box data structure with samples
Show how renderer uses these
Explain how dimensionality is handled…
Error: Sources and and how they manifest
State of the art in sampling (10 mins) 
Classical: Random, Jittered, Latin HC …
QMC: Sobol, Hammersley 
Blue Noise: Poisson disk, CCVT, Victor’s 
Spectral specification
The reconstruction problem (10 mins)
Define problem
Signal processing: Nyquist, Balakrishnan, Dippe and Wold, …
Vision, perception: Yellott, Ulichney ...
Graphics: Mitchell, cook, shirley, …
transition via Mitchell’s analysis
Quality assessment? 
(Alvy Ray Smith (1995) has emphatically pointed out, thinking of pixels as small squares with finite area is an incorrect mental model that leads to a series of errors)
Break (5 mins) : Questions? 
Integration using stochastic sampling (30 mins) 
Define problem
Error in the fourier domain
Errors in integration due to sampling (30 mins)
The canonical domain
From first principles
MSE vs variance/bias. Relevance of phase.
Measuring/predicting error
periodogram: show examples in case study
amplitude of the expected Fourier spectrum: show examples 
behaviour at low frequencies (slope of the spectrum as it approaches DC): show all examples in case study
