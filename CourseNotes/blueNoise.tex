\section{Blue noise}
\GURPRIT{
I think the we can cover different classes of samplers if we can simply rename the subsections of this 
section to the following: \\
- Dart throwing based methods \\
- Relaxation based methods \\
- Tiling based methods 
}
\KARTIC{I've modified CCVT to Relaxation-based. However, I think Poisson-disk sampling is the general idea for which dart-based methods are used (rather than the other way around), so I've kept the first subsection PDisk}

\GURPRIT{This is correct but we can also generate Poisson disk sampling using relaxation based methods 
and/or tile based methods (Kopf et al.2006, Lagae and Dutre 2008). I was actually proposing to separate the generation process of sampling patterns. Dart throwing is one way of generating samples, which by 
default give Poisson disk patterns.
